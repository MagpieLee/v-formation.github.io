**"Never run a start-up! You are not ready."**

Starting a business can be an exciting and rewarding experience, but it can also be filled with challenges and obstacles. In this post, we will explore my journey towards entrepreneurship started.

I was told by a start-up accelerator and a trusted colleague that "You never run a start-up!" Despite initially rebelling and pleading, the statement stung deeply and led to many nights of soul-searching and self-doubt.

I experienced an emotional rollercoaster as my spirit wandered in the land of self-doubts. My inner self questioned my ability to persuade others, sell my ideas, and whether I was truly fit for the job of starting a business.

Days later, I ultimately decided not to pursue a start-up, but instead to run experiments while still maintaining their main job, for now. This decision will allow me to test my ideas and refine my approach to entrepreneurship, while also providing a stable source of income for my family. Meals for my family, tutions for my college kids, mortgages for my house, and what not.

Starting a business can be a challenging and risky journey for someone like me who has to feed a family. But I believe it can also be incredibly rewarding no matter what. By embracing experimentation and taking calculated risks, I can reduce the risk. Whether or not I ever run a start-up, the journey towards entrepreneurship would be an opportunity for growth, self-discovery, and personal fulfillment.
